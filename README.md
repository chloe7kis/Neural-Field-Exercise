Training a Neural Field to Represent Image

The objective is to reconstruct a given image using a neural network while enforcing symmetric image output. The contributions include training a neural network model using positional encoding with Fourier features based on the NeRF architecture. Additionally, other methods such as CNN and Transformer were applied for comparison.
